# Venus
Initially known as Melon, this was a multi-purpose bot for Discord that I worked on during 2018-19, with the help of several other contributors at that time.

Powered by Discord.js and several other NPM packages, this project was completely scrapped during July 2019 after losing interest altogether. This repository stores the code for Venus v1.6.1, the last publicly-released version before the project was scrapped.

Please note, the bot may not start/function properly as the underlying code is obviously outdated. No official support will be given for the code.
